# Boinc Project Configurator

This is a command-line interface for making (and changing) configuration options on a project basis, ones that you can not control in the standard boinc manager (like number of concurrent processes per project, how many gpu processes running at once, disable the gpu just for this instance, etc)

Written in Rust, wanted to see how the language was
